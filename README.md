Tree for Doc Type Grid Editors
=========================

This package adds a tree in the developer section, for handling Doc Type Grid Editor package.manifest files. You can also right click a document type, and create a Doc Type Grid Editor directly.

## Installation

Currently not packaged, as some parts are bound to the way we work work DTGE at Ecreo (making a smooth experience with git, Skybrud.Umbraco.GridData etc.). But feel free, to fork and make your own package if you'd like.

## Features

- Add and edit package.manifest files through the Umbraco backoffice
- Generate package.manifest files based on a specific doctype, including name, alias, icon.
